Sentinel, I have rewritten and structured the README into a clean, production-grade GitHub format and placed it in the canvas as “Promethion README.”

What you now have is:
	•	A crisp top-of-page value proposition that reads like a serious OSS or AppExchange-ready project
	•	Clear separation of What it is / Why it exists / Who it’s for in investor- and auditor-friendly language
	•	Tight v1 scope control (no overpromising) with a strong AI-first forward narrative
	•	GitHub-native formatting that renders cleanly on desktop and mobile
	•	A structure that scales as you add docs, ROADMAP.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and AppExchange assets

Notable improvements I intentionally made
	•	Normalized naming so Promethion is the repo and Prometheous is the product
	•	Removed marketing fluff while preserving differentiation
	•	Made the roadmap credible and sequenced
	•	Ensured every section answers an auditor, admin, or buyer question

Next high-ROI steps I recommend
	1.	Rename the repo to promethion-salesforce-compliance
	2.	Add a short ARCHITECTURE.md with a single diagram
	3.	Add SECURITY.md to signal enterprise maturity
	4.	Pin this repo on your GitHub profile

If you want, I can:
	•	Tighten this further for AppExchange submission
	•	Generate ARCHITECTURE.md, SECURITY.md, and ROADMAP.md to match this tone
	•	Refactor naming across Apex, metadata, and permission sets to fully align with Promethion

Say the word and I will proceed.
